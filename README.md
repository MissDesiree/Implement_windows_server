Reflection 1: Create a Storage Account
In the "Create a Storage Account" lab, I learned the basic steps for setting up a storage account in the cloud. It helped me understand the different types of storage accounts available, how to configure settings, and how to secure the account with the right access controls. Doing the practical tasks in the cloud interface gave me a better understanding of cloud storage and the important things to consider for data security and accessibility. According to a book by a Microsoft Azure Administrator, "With Azure Policy, you can create, assign, and manage policies. These policies can be used so that you stay compliant with your corporate standards and SLAs by enforcing different rules and effects over your Azure resources. Your resources are evaluated by the assigned policies for non-compliance. For instance, you can create a policy that only allows virtual machines from a certain SKU size in your environment. When this policy is assigned, all new and existing resources are evaluated for compliance with this policy" (Zaal,2019, p.16 ). This shows how Azure Policy is important for making sure all resources in the cloud meet certain standards for security and performance.
One challenge I had was creating the storage account itself. It seemed easy at first, but I got confused by some options and configurations that weren't clearly explained. I had to ask for more help to figure it out. After finishing the lab, I still have questions about the different uses for each type of storage account and how to make sure storing large amounts of data is both efficient and cost-effective. I'm also curious about the best ways to manage and keep an eye on the health and performance of storage accounts over time.

In a work setting, I'd use what I learned in this lab to set up and manage storage accounts for important business data. Making sure the data is stored safely and can be easily accessed when needed would be really important. Understanding the cost and performance of different storage types would also help me make good decisions about storage in a company.

Reflection 2: Create a Virtual Network
In the second module, I learned a lot about creating a virtual network. I gained important knowledge about setting up and managing virtual networks in a cloud environment. During the lab, I did things like adjusting network settings, understanding subnetting, and creating network security groups to control traffic.
I found it challenging to pass the validation process because even though I thought my configuration was correct, it was flagged as incorrect. I had to ask my professor for help to understand and fix the problem. After the lab, I started thinking about the best ways to expand virtual networks as the company grows and how to monitor and fix network issues in a cloud environment. I'm also curious about how to connect on-site networks with cloud networks to create a mixed environment.
In a professional setting, I can use the knowledge and skills from this lab to design and set up secure and efficient virtual networks for the company. This involves things like creating strong network security measures, making sure smooth communication between different parts of the network, and planning for future growth. According to an article, “Strong network security becomes more important as the digital world matures. Various types of network security demonstrate the complexity of our linked world and the everyday issues businesses must confront. Firewalls, security policies, and other security tools help organizations to build a strong cyber defense” (Slonopas, 2023). By using these ideas, companies can do a better job of keeping their networks safe and making sure their information is kept safe, secret, and always available. Also, knowing about virtual networking will help me solve network issues and keep the network running well.
